# Analysing financial data in Tableau

The Tableau project presents a comprehensive financial analysis and data modelling dashboard for Westmoreland Pvt Ltd, covering the years 2018 to 2020. The dashboard includes key financial metrics such as Sales, Gross Profit, EBITDA, Operating Profit, and Net Profit, illustrating the company's financial performance and profitability trends over the three-year period. It provides detailed insights into sales performance by region and country, along with visualizations of gross profit margins and net profit margins.

The project also features a detailed Income Statement summary highlighting trends in sales, cost of sales, marketing expenses, and other operating and non-operating income and expenses. Additionally, it presents a Statement of Financial Position that tracks assets, liabilities, and owners' equity, including the breakdown of non-current and current assets, share capital, retained earnings, and liabilities.

Users can explore the data by month, quarter, region, and country, making it a powerful tool for financial reporting, forecasting, and strategic decision-making. The dashboard leverages Tableauâ€™s capabilities to visualize complex financial data clearly and interactively, supporting a deep understanding of the company's financial health and operational efficiency.
